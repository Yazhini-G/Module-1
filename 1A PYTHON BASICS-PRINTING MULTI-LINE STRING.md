# Experiment No: 1a Python Basics- Printing Multiline String

## AIM  
To write a Python program that prints a string across multiple lines using triple single quotes and triple double quotes.

## ALGORITHM  
1.Start the program.
2.Use triple single quotes to define and print a multiline string.
3.Use triple double quotes to define and print the same multiline string.
4.End the program. 

## PROGRAM
print('''I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
....placed inside triple single quotes ''')
print("""I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
....placed inside triple double quotes """)
