# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Subtracting Two Complex Numbers

## AIM
To write a Python program to subtract two complex numbers, where the complex numbers c1 = 8 + 4j and c2 = 5 + 2j are given.

## ALGORITHM
1.Start the program
Open the Python environment and create a new script.
2.Define complex numbers
Define the complex numbers c1 = 8 + 4j and c2 = 5 + 2j in the program.
3.Subtract the complex numbers
Subtract the two complex numbers: c1 - c2.
4.Print the result
Display the result of the subtraction using the print() function.
5.End the program.
Ensure that the program runs successfully and displays the correct output.

## PROGRAM
c1=8+4j
c2=5+2j
c3=c1-c2
print(c3)

## OUTPUT
